Machine learning techniques have been suggested as promising alternatives to logistic regression for the estimation of propensity scores. 
This study evaluates the performance of five propensity score estimation methods- logistic regression, classification and regression trees,random forest, 
gradient boosting and bagging across seven simulated treatment assignment scenarios with varying complexity. 
Methods were assessed with on absolute relative bias(ARB), covariate balance(ASAM),Standard error, 
and 95% Confidence interval coverage at multiple sample sizes.
